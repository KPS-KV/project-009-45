    "1. Data Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This project uses two datasets obtained from a UBC research Minecraft server. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **players.csv** - contains information about each unique player, including demographic and behavioral data.\n",
    "2. **sessions.csv** — contains information about individual play sessions for each player.\n",
    "\n",
    "These datasets together help understand player behavior and predict engagement outcomes such as newsletter subscription.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Potential issues you cannot see directly (hidden concerns)**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sampling bias:** Players present in the dataset are only those who logged into the server — they may not represent the entire intended population. For example, people who tried once then never returned are underrepresented.\n",
    "2. **Measurement error:** \"total_playtime\" may be aggregated differently, or may include idle time if the server doesn't strictly record active play.\n",
    "3. **Time zone and timestamp consistency:** If session timestamps are in different time zones or recorded inconsistently, derived features (like first-week activity) could be miscomputed later.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data collection notes**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data were collected from server logs and registration records for the research Minecraft server.\n",
    "2. Demographic data (age, gender) likely come from optional registration fields or post-registration surveys; the accuracy depends on self-reporting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:** The dataset is good enough for an initial descriptive analysis and for modeling a binary outcome (newsletter subscription). However, we must be careful with missing values, outliers, and potential bias when interpreting predictive results."
